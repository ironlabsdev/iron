   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Restart your terminal** or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`)

### Permission denied

If you get permission errors:

```bash
# Make the binary executable
chmod +x /path/to/iron

# Or reinstall with proper permissions
sudo chown $(whoami) /usr/local/bin/iron
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/iron
```
